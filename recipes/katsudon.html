        <p>
            I am so obsessed with it, it's become one of my go to meal, a comfort food if you will. I think the kewpie mayonaise and green onions on top are
            what's really bringing the dish together, like a little bonus.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cooking the rice</strong> 
                <p>
                    First, will need some rice. Personally I use a rice cooker and make 2 cups of rice, I find that is the best quantity for two servings.
                    Before you cook your rice, make sure to wash it until the wather runs clear, we want extra sticky rice.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Frying the pork chops</strong>
                <p>
                    Coat your pork chops into flour, egg and panko respectivly. Next, put some canola oil (or other oil safe for frying food) in a large pan
                    and heat it up. Once the oil is hot enough, carefully drop your pork chops in the pan and cook each side until they are golden brown
                    (about 2 minutes) or until the meat is fully cooked. Once it is, set it aside for later.

        </ol>
