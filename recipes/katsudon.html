        <p>
            I am so obsessed with it, it's become one of my go to meal, a comfort food if you will. I think the kewpie mayonaise and green onions on top are
            what's really bringing the dish together, like a little bonus.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cooking the rice</strong> 
                <p>
                    First, we'll need some rice. Personally I use a rice cooker and make 2 cups of rice, I find that is the best quantity for two servings.
                    Before you cook your rice, make sure to wash it until the wather runs clear, we want extra sticky rice.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Frying the pork chops</strong>
                <p>
                    Coat your pork chops into flour, egg and panko respectivly. Next, put some canola oil (or other oil safe for frying food) in a large pan
                    and heat it up. Once the oil is hot enough, carefully drop your pork chops in the pan and cook each side until they are golden brown
                    (about 2 minutes) or until the meat is fully cooked. Once it is, set it aside for later. 
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Preparing the onions</strong>
                <p>
                    Slice one onions for each portion (if it's for two then slice two). Cook them in a pan with olive oil until golden brown. For two servings,
                    add 5 table spoons of soy sauce and stir it onto the onions. Then, add 2 table spoons off rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar and stir everything
                    together once again.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Slice your pork chops and lay them down on the onions. Beat two eggs and pour them in the pan. Cover, reduce the heat, and let everything rest until
                    the eggs are cooked to your linking.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Seasoning the rice</strong>
                <p>
                    Now, I like my rice extra sticky so if you're like me, follow this step. Once your rice is fully cooked, you'll want to add 75 ml of rice
                    vinegar (for two cups of rice), salt and sugar. Mix about 3 times each with an interval of a couple of minutes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Putting everything together</strong>
                <p>
                    Once step 4 is done, you'll want to lay your pork chops along with the onions on a bowl of rice. Add kewpie mayonaise to your taste and some
                    chopped green onions.
